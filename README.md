## What was that?

Hey, if you are here is because you struggle all across internet looking for an easy way to serialize images so you can send them through json across your services right? Well, that was my biggest issue! 

After many hours looking for something I found this wonderful person (https://stackoverflow.com/q/30698004) which gave me the needed answer. I decided then to make things easier for me and anyone who is looking for something like this and build this little project which can be added to your server or project and help to get serializable images which has guaranteed success! Please Enjoy!

## Give a hand then!
